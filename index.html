            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Jackson County's growing population has created a need for an additional public high school to alleviate overcrowding in existing facilities. The current distribution of high schools does not adequately serve all areas of the county, particularly in emerging population centers. This imbalance creates transportation challenges and educational inequities for students in underserved regions.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Research Question:</strong> Where is the most suitable location for a new public high school in Jackson County, Oregon, based on demographic, geographic, and infrastructure factors?
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Study Area & Data</h2>
            <p>Jackson County is located in southwestern Oregon, encompassing approximately 2,800 square miles of diverse terrain from the Rogue Valley to the Cascade Mountains. The county has a population of approximately 220,000 residents with most concentrated in the cities of Medford, Ashland, and Central Point along the Interstate 5 corridor. The region is characterized by a mix of urban centers, suburban communities, and rural areas with significant geographical features including mountains, rivers, and forests.</p>
            
            <p>This analysis utilized several GIS datasets including public high school locations, U.S. Census block groups with age demographic data (particularly ages 15-19), major road networks, and county library locations. All data was clipped to the Jackson County boundary and filtered to focus exclusively on public high schools, excluding private educational institutions.</p>

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            
            <h3>Projection</h3>
            <p>This analysis utilized the NAD 1983 Oregon Statewide Lambert projection (EPSG: 2992). This projection was selected because it is optimized for the state of Oregon, minimizing distortion across the study area. As a Lambert Conformal Conic projection, it preserves angular relationships and shape while maintaining reasonable accuracy for distance and area measurements, which is critical for buffer operations and proximity analyses conducted throughout this study.</p>
            
            <h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
            <div class="criteria-list">
                <div class="criteria-item">
                    <h3>Criterion 1</h3>
                    <p><strong>Distance from Existing High Schools</strong> - Areas beyond 5 miles from existing high schools were considered suitable, as this represents a reasonable distance threshold for identifying underserved areas while maintaining appropriate school distribution.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="criteria-item">
                    <h3>Criterion 2</h3>
                    <p><strong>Teen Population Density</strong> - Block groups with high concentrations of teenagers (ages 15-19) were prioritized, as these areas represent the primary service population for high schools. Areas with 200+ teens were considered highly suitable, while areas with fewer than 100 teens were deemed unsuitable.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="criteria-item">
                    <h3>Criterion 3</h3>
                    <p><strong>Proximity to Major Roads</strong> - Areas within 0.5 miles of major roads were prioritized to ensure transportation accessibility for students, staff, and emergency services. This criterion also addresses considerations for bus routes and private vehicle access.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="criteria-item">
                    <h3>Criterion 4</h3>
                    <p><strong>Proximity to Libraries</strong> - Areas close to county libraries (within 1 mile) were favored to provide additional educational resources and support facilities for students. This criterion recognizes the value of complementary educational infrastructure.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="method-comparison">
                <div class="method-column">
                    <h3>Boolean Method</h3>
                    <p>The Boolean suitability analysis utilized a binary approach where each criterion was converted to a simple "suitable" or "not suitable" classification. Areas meeting the minimum threshold for each criterion (beyond 5 miles from existing schools, having sufficient teen population, within 0.5 miles of major roads, and within 1 mile of libraries) were identified. These suitable areas were then combined using the intersect operation, which identified only locations that simultaneously satisfied all four criteria, effectively applying a logical AND operation across all constraints.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="method-column">
                    <h3>Ranked Method</h3>
                    <p>The ranked suitability analysis employed a more nuanced approach by assigning scores from 1 (most suitable) to 4 (least suitable) for each criterion based on varying degrees of suitability. These scores were then weighted according to the relative importance of each factor (40% for teen population, 30% for distance from existing schools, 15% for road proximity, and 15% for library access) and combined mathematically to produce a composite suitability score ranging from 1 to 4. This method allowed for trade-offs between criteria and provided a gradient of suitability across the study area.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Assumptions</h3>
            <p>This analysis was bounded by several key assumptions. First, the study area was limited to Jackson County boundaries, presuming that administrative considerations would prohibit siting a school outside county lines. Second, we assumed that teen population density in block groups accurately represents the future student body distribution, not accounting for potential population growth trends or demographic shifts. Third, our weighting scheme (40% teen population, 30% distance from existing schools, 15% road access, 15% library proximity) assumes teen population and school distribution are substantially more important than transportation and resource access in determining optimal school locations.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, we assumed that physical constraints like steep terrain, flood zones, or land ownership were not limiting factors. In practice, these could significantly restrict site availability. Finally, we made the simplifying assumption that straight-line distance is an adequate proxy for travel time and accessibility, which may not hold true in areas with complex road networks or geographical barriers.</p>

                    <p>The Boolean analysis identified a small number of locations that satisfied all criteria simultaneously, with the primary suitable area located in the northern region of the county (highlighted in the map). This location is sufficiently distant from existing high schools, has a substantial teen population, good road access, and proximity to library resources. The limited number of suitable sites reflects the restrictive nature of Boolean analysis, which requires all conditions to be met without compromise.</p>

                    <p>The ranked analysis revealed a broader range of potentially suitable locations, with varying degrees of suitability indicated by the color gradient. The highest suitability scores (closest to 1.0) were found in several areas, predominantly in the northern and eastern portions of the county. Notably, the area identified in the Boolean analysis received the highest suitability score in the ranked analysis as well. The ranked method provided more flexibility by identifying locations that may excel in some criteria while being adequate in others.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>Both the Boolean and ranked analyses converged on identifying the northern portion of Jackson County as the most suitable location for a new high school. This area represents an optimal balance of distance from existing educational facilities, demographic need as evidenced by teen population, transportation accessibility, and proximity to complementary educational resources. The agreement between methods strengthens confidence in this recommendation, as the location satisfies both the strict requirements of the Boolean approach and achieves the highest composite score in the more flexible ranked analysis.</p>

                <div class="image-caption">Figure 4: Most suitable location identified for the new public high school facility in Jackson County. This site received a final suitability ranking score of 1.7.</div>
                <p>The optimal location for the new high school facility is situated in the northeastern section of Jackson County, as shown by the red square in the map above. With a suitability score of 1.7 on our 1-4 scale (where 1 represents the highest suitability), this site demonstrates strong performance across all evaluated criteria. It provides sufficient distance from existing high schools, serves an area with a significant teenage population, offers excellent accessibility via major roadways, and maintains proximity to complementary educational resources. The site's position would help address the current service gap in the northern portion of the county while maintaining efficient accessibility for the surrounding community.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The Boolean method provided a clear, unambiguous identification of locations meeting all minimum requirements, effectively eliminating areas with any significant shortcomings. This approach is valuable for initial screening but may be overly restrictive in complex planning scenarios. In contrast, the ranked method offered a more nuanced perspective by allowing for compensation between criteria and revealing gradients of suitability. This approach identified not only the most suitable location but also several alternative sites that could merit consideration if the primary location proves problematic for reasons not captured in the analysis.</p>
            
            <p>The consistency between methods suggests that the identified northern location truly represents an underserved area with significant potential for a new high school. The high teen population in this area, combined with its distance from existing schools, indicates that a new facility here would address a genuine educational need rather than merely redistributing students from existing schools. Additionally, the site's good connectivity to transportation infrastructure would facilitate student access, while its proximity to library resources would enhance educational opportunities.</p>
            
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Despite the robust methodology employed, this analysis contains several limitations that should inform interpretation of the results. First, the analysis did not consider land availability, ownership patterns, or parcel size, which could significantly constrain actual site selection within the identified suitable areas. A high-suitability location may be unavailable due to protected status, private ownership, or insufficient developable land. Second, the static nature of the demographic data fails to account for projected population growth and migration patterns, which could alter the distribution of the student-age population over the timeframe required to plan and construct a new facility.</p>
            
                <p>Additionally, the analysis did not incorporate factors such as socioeconomic considerations, existing school capacities, or potential environmental impacts, which would be essential elements in a comprehensive school planning process. The equal treatment of all existing high schools disregards differences in their enrollment levels, academic programs, and future expansion potential. Finally, public perception and community preferences, which often play a decisive role in educational facility planning, were not factored into the suitability models. These limitations suggest that while the GIS analysis provides a valuable starting point for site selection, it should be supplemented with additional stakeholder input and detailed site-specific assessments before final decisions are made.</p>
